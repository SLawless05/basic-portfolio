            My name is Scott Lawless. I try to be well rounded but I am somewhat easily defined as an avid gamer a my
            core. I play games frequently and it is an activity I enjoy as much as any other that I've been fortunate
            enough to try. My "main game" is League of Legends and I will regularly play 10 or more games per week. I
            also play many other games a few shooters, a few rts games as well as a grand strategy game in eu4 (7000
            hours played in 4-5 years this game is addicting).
            <br>
            I am also heavily interested in e-sports (with the main title I watch being League of Legends again).
            I also watch counterstrike and dota2 esports(even though I'm rather bad at each) and as well watch quite
            a few different fighting game scenes(which I'm eveb worse at). I really find it awe-inspireing and
            entertaining. It's oft-maligned in popular media but I think they lack the gamer perspective to be able to
            appreciate what goes in to really big plays or really clever strategies.
            <br>
            Outside of gaming I am also a huge dog person. I grew up around many dogs (and some cats) because my mom
            worked as a puppy-raiser and trainer for a service dog company. I currently Have one dog and he is a
            black-lab named Levi(pictures coming soon). He was a service dog that my mom trained that was placed with a
            person who died shortly after his placement. Normally they would place him with someone else as he was
            young and healthy however he had gained some health issues in the shorty time after he was placed and
            although they were temporary issues the decision was made to leave them with us while he recovered. then
            when he recovered the dog raising organisation had gone under some leadership changes and the new
            leadership decided to just give us the dog, thats how he became mine!
